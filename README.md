Topic Searching

1. Find your interest area and check if you have the skills for the topic (stomach contents in collection birds in this case).
2. Choose a new and important topic in this area.
3. Ask for help. A tutor can tell if the study is possible or not. Get many opinions to understand and improve the idea.
4. Check if the topic was already done.
5. If the topic was already done, you have two options: 5.1. Choose another topic. 5.2. Add more information to the topic, answer more questions about it.
6. Create a clear and simple research question. Check previous publications and ask your tutor.

Research Activities

7. Search for important articles and studies for your project.
8. Organize the articles to find them easily later.
9. Plan how to review the studies to avoid too much information.
10. Look at the summaries and main points of the studies.
11. Write the theoretical framework using the information from the studies.
12. Make a detailed plan for your research, thinking about resources and time.

Drafting the Written Work

13. Collect and review important literature to start the theoretical framework.
14. Make an outline for the theoretical framework, from general to specific.
15. Divide the framework into parts and set deadlines for each part.
16. Use a notebook or app to record important ideas and references.
17. Include the research problem in your paragraphs.
18. Identify gaps in the topic with the help of previous studies.
19. Write the research question clearly after explaining the problem.
20. Define a hypothesis based on the research question, make it testable.
21. Write the general objective of the research.
22. Break the general objective into smaller specific objectives.
23. Get feedback from a tutor to ensure the text is good.
24. Check the reliability of articles and publications you use.

Laboratory Analysis

25. Have a clean lab with all the needed equipment: dissection kit, trays, Petri dishes, filter paper, ethanol, pipettes, beakers, cryovials, stereoscope, sharps container, waste bin, and reagent container.
26. Label the cryovial with the sample number and put the carcass in ethanol in a Petri dish.
27. Find the ventral area and use tweezers to lift the chest to see the stomach and intestines. Extract the stomach carefully.
28. Use a scalpel to cut from the start to the end of the digestive tract. Put the section in 70% ethanol in a Petri dish.
29. Use a syringe to measure the crop and stomach. Make a small cut in the stomach to access the inside without puncturing it.
30. Continued
Prepare beakers with ethanol and filter paper.
31. Use a pipette to put stomach contents into a Petri dish. Measure the intestines and write down the data. Put the stomach and intestines back in the carcass.
32. Filter the stomach contents into a beaker and then put them in a cryovial with ethanol.
33. Do the same process for the crop and put its contents in a separate cryovial.
34. Measure the crop and stomach again without their contents.
35. Dispose of used ethanol in a labeled container.
36. Clean and reuse blades or throw them away in the sharps container. Put biological waste in a red bag.
37. This method saves the tissue and stores the stomach contents well.
38. To analyze, pour the cryovial contents into a Petri dish and add ethanol often.
39. After analysis, filter the contents again and store them in fresh ethanol.
40. Dispose of used ethanol in the correct container.
41. Write down all data and keep a copy as per the UIS protocols.

Data Analysis

42. Digitize the collected data.
43. Do statistical analyses on the data.
44. Ask a tutor to check the analyses and suggest more tests.
45. Make sure all data is open for others to check.

Results

46. Show the results with clear graphs. Explain why you chose each graph type.
47. Write a detailed caption for each image and graph.
48. Discussion and Conclusions

Explain the results and what they mean.

49. Compare your results with other studies.
50. Discuss how your findings relate to previous research.
51. Summarize the main conclusions of your research.

References and Appendices

52. Check all citations to make sure they are correct and easy to find.
53. Make all data open so others can check and validate the results.
54. The crop and stomach contents are in the tissue section at UIS. Access is limited, but you can ask for permission from the UIS School of Biology.
